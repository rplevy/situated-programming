<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>
In the folklore of computing, the turn of phrase "bicycle for the
mind"<sup>1</sup> characterizes the aims of intelligence amplification
(IA) efforts by way of reference to the well-established scientific
fact that bicycles come astonishingly close to making total use of a
person's self-generated mechanical power.  A bicycle is the most
efficient vehicle to harness a human's own power toward locomotive
objectives.<sup>2</sup> Can computing technology similarly be used to
maximally leverage human powers of perception/action and narrative
sense-making?
</p>

<p>
The metaphor raises an obvious question: why not an electric bicycle,
or a self-steering sailboat, or a telepresence drone-- for the mind,
for that matter?  Power tools of thought are ultimately what we want,
but there is risk in putting them first.  The bicycle model of
amplifying human powers highlights the challenge of how to extend
agency with technologies closely fit to core human competencies and
needs.  Skipping this necessary first step seems to lead down a path
of not augmenting human capacities, but instead supplanting them in
ways that tend to integrate poorly with the actual interests and needs
of users.  It leads to inscrutable oracles that trade off
accountability and expertise for short-sighted convenience.
</p>

<p>
We do not yet have anything quite analogous to bicycles for the full
power of the embodied human mind.  But the history of human life is a
story of individuals and groups developing practices and tools for
scaffolding and extending personhood.  I suppose we could think of
some of these innovations as wheelbarrows or shovels for the mind,
augmenting capacities to participate in the world in specific ways.
To measure up to the standards of our analogy from human mechanical
power, a bicycle will likely have to extend root human competencies
that enable all these specific kinds.  But a long time ago humans did
begin developing something close to a bicycle for the mind-- language.
Language is at base a means (but not the only means) of codifying
joint attention and cooperation in a way that enables us to share in
advanced content-bearing activities of both direct and abstract
construal.<sup>3</sup> The limitations of language are shown by the
only partly overlapping power of other workhorses such as music,
pictoriality, math notations, etc, but the incredible power of
language as a means of scaffolding is why language-aware computing has
been a holy grail for the field.  Needless to say, conversation has
not yet become accessible to tooling except in trivial ways.
</p>

<p>
All of that said, I do not believe it is correct to say "natural
language understanding" is the bicycle for the mind, but rather that
NLU is probably only achievable by layering on top of a more
fundamental level of tooling: the instrumenting of joint attention.  I
will make a case here that the bicycle for the mind is likely to be
developed in the context of "situated programming", because only by
instrumenting and tracking events in processes of motivated attending
to environments together, can we scaffold the processes of joint
attention that constitute the foundational framework from which the
human niche emerges.  The aim is to augment action/perception by
scaffolding joint attention as the basis for amplifying situation
awareness and narrative sense-making, in augmented, virtual, and mixed
environments.
</p>

<p>
I call this work a "manifesto" because I don't consider it an idle
theoretical exercise, but instead as advocacy for certain approaches
and courses of action that are motivated by real problems in society,
technology, and science.  Alan Kay once remarked that "the best way to
predict to future is to invent it".  Likewise the best way to make
sense of history is to excavate from it the most sound basis for the
direction one is inventing toward.  I survey three major trends
tracing all the way back to the birth of modern human primates:
attending, working, and organizing.  Starting with the origins of
joint attentional scaffolding and following a thread through changes
that have impacted the scale of attention, work, and social
organization, I draft a roadmap to an ecology of bicycles for the
mind.  I have kept references to authors, works, and prior art in the
endnotes apart from the main text to simplify presentation.

<a name="agents-and-their-environments"></a>
<div class="page">
<h3>AGENTS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTS</h3>

<p>
Two of the oldest questions in philosophy and science are "what is
life?" and "what is mind?".  Only a mere 150 years ago<sup>1</sup> did
it begin to dawn on pragmatic thinkers that these two questions are
actually one question: "what is an agent?".  To ask what an agent is
is to ask what the difference is between inert mechanisms and living,
feeling, self-steering mechanisms.  So the question naturally becomes
one of feedback and control mechanisms.  Agents are systems that act
to control parameters of environments that matter to them.  To speak
of an "environment of" or "mattering to" a system requires a physical
explanation, and that explanation is given by natural selection.
Mattering is a consequence of evolution because physico-chemical
arrangements are either ephemeral or they persist through targeted
manufacture, maintenance, acquisition of resources, and so on.  To
persist requires control of factors bearing on persistence, as biases
or preferences.  In other words, those things matter to the agent.
</p>

<p>
An agent, minimally defined, is a system that exercises control over
factors ultimately tied to its persistence as an autonomous entity
over time.  Factors that may be required for the unity of the system
to endure but are less directly controllable by the agent are called
the environment of an agent.  It is important to note that up until
here, when we speak of mattering to an agent it is meant strictly in
terms of outcomes that can be observed in the functioning of the
system by an outside observer.  What is called "perception" is an
agent's active sensitivity to ecological features called affordances
that bear upon control objectives.  To say affordances matter to an
agent, is to say that the real outcomes matter (both in terms of
learning effective habits and in terms of reproduction/survival
viability), but also to remark on the first-hand phenomenology of
proactive sensitivity to ecological properties.  This latter aspect
becomes more sophisticated and pronounced in more complex species.
</p>

<p>
The following three modes or predicaments are definitionally universal
to agents.<sup>2</sup> All agents from the most basic kind to human
agents must contend with these.
</p>

<ol>
<li><u>ENGAGING</u>: An agent is situated in environments that afford
many opportunities and threats demanding awareness and readiness to
potentially engage promising ends and mitigate perilous eventualities.
Any engagement has opportunity costs, so an agent must budget
attention<sup>3</sup> wisely.  <b>The predicament of engaging is that
of classifying events as indicative of means to valued ends, in
deciding to engage or not.</b>

<li><u>SUPPORTING</u>: Support, in the sense of contribution of work
or effort, refers to relationships that hold between a presently
engaged process and one or more potential or ongoing process of an
agent. <b>The predicament for the agent is to what extent does the
work of a secondary engagement contribute to (or hinder) the
realization of the present enagement's objective, in deciding to
include in scope or not.</b> In economics, the term "disutility of
work" captures a key aspect of what agents must optimize in this
predicament: ideally only those supporting processes that contribute
to realizing valued ends should be involved, and others should be
excluded.  The phenomenon of concentration or focus is also expressed
by optimally excluding/including supporting or subordinate engagement.

<li><u>REALIZING</u>: The third predicament that agents contend with
is that of organizing final causes. Final causes are those that
motivate the second predicament above and indirectly, the first as
well. <b>The predicament is that of defining ends, in deciding to
continue or exit. What defines the unique character or meaning of
realized ends is the specific set of options that are available to
exit to.</b>  In general, positions that offer more options (giving
the agent more autonomy, rather than being at the mercy of
circumstance) appear to be favorable, all other things being equal.
</ol>

<h3>JOINT ATTENTION: THE HUMAN NICHE</h3>

<p>
Human agents are indisputably a unique case among natural agents.
What characterizes the "sapience" of humans, as distinct from the more
widespread "sentience" of basic acting/perceiving agents more broadly,
is our capacity to carry out content-bearing narrative and
propositional acts.  Such capacities are not deep or intrinsic to
intelligence by any means.  The rich variety of sentient intelligence
in nature manifests as purely pragmatic capacities of agents to steer
events toward ends that matter-- solely in terms of direct bearing on
positioning or readiness, often to the mutual benefit of agents.  The
skills supporting sapience are no exception, but they have opened for
our species a radically novel niche unlike any other
animal's.<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p>
This narrative kind of agency is wholly due to a set of evolved
capacities constituting a cooperative infrastructure of communication
that began with gesture.<sup>2</sup> The function of gesture,
including pointing and pantomime is to share, follow, and direct the
flow of motivated attending.  While other species engage in joint
attention<sup>3</sup>, only humans are known to be capable of what has
been called "triadic joint attention" in which two or more agents
attend to a shared focus, and crucially, <i>coordinate a shared end
motivating the focus</i>.
</p>

<p>
<center><img src="assets/sentience-vs-sapience.png" height="200"></center>
</p>

<p>
Joint attention is important for two reasons.  The first reason is
that it is directly responsible for human intentionally organized
tools and practices.  This is because when agents externally
coordinate events that bear upon engagement, support, and realization,
they are defining and shaping shared processes of narratively
organized agency.  The second reason, a consequence of the first, is
that the practices and tools that arise in service of joint attention
become a rich repository of scaffolding that constitutes tacit and
explicit common ground supporting the many varieties of social
interactions.  The accumulation of scaffolding offers potentially
endless options for agents to extend the reach of their
world-involving activities in socially sharable ways.
</p>

<p>
The earliest stages of human societies mark the beginnings of a
history of tools and practices (such as paintings, masks, signs,
speaking, etc) for scaffolding joint attention.  Scaffolding is still
by and large a highly localized activity between small groups of
people, though the coordination of local activities has been
significantly broadened by technologies of writing, the printing
press, mass media, and the internet.  Disseminable graphical practices
such as writing and diagramming exemplify
how <b>extensive</b><sup>4</sup> sapient agents are: the reach and
influence of involvement in the world is amplified by distributed
scaffolding practices. Bicycles for the mind aim to <i>immediatize</i>
these wide feedback loops so as to scale awareness, sense-making, and
organizational practices.
</p>

</div>

<a name="the-scalability-of-attention-work-and-social-organization">
<div class="page">
<h3>THE SCALABILITY OF ATTENTION, WORK, AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION</h3>
<p>
In the definition of agency introduced above, three predicaments were
identified that any account or specification of basic sentient agents
will have to address.  I then added a layer on top of this for sapient
agents, agents that engage in collaborative narrative sense-making
practices: not only do we directly engage the world toward ends, but
we engage that subset of our environments that is other agents,
developing sensitivity to other agents' states of engaging,
supporting, and realizing objectives, in navigating and negotiating
the direction of attention. For sapient agents, what arises from the
three basic agent predicaments, are three common concerns addressed in
diverse ways over the course of history.
</p>

<ol>
<li><u>ATTENTION</u> Any social unit, however temporary or
time-extended, and however large or small, is confronted with the need
for coordination on what merits attention.  Agents develop a shared
awareness or common involvement in making sense of events as bearing
on shared concerns.
<li><u>WORK</u> Any social unit is confronted with the need for ways
of having effects on the world together. Tools and machines have
greatly expanded our capacities to work toward objectives.
Technologies of attention, such as diagramming and notation, serve to
affect agents' processes of realizing specific ends.
<li><u>SOCIAL ORGANIZATION</u> Any social unit is confronted with the
need to coordinate on final causes that constitute "what we want to
happen".  This can include anything from a preference to avoid places
with cold temperatures in an outing together, to political causes,
legal justice rulings, or the incentive structure of a game.
</ol>

<p>
All evidence suggests that the primary original driver of increasingly
advanced cooperation amplified by joint attention in proto-human
primates was the stag hunt.  Big game hunting required more than one
person's help, and the better they coordinated, the better results
they got on average.  However early human societies did not gather in
groups much larger than other primates did, because of the limitations
of keeping track of one another and coordinating collective efforts.
Humans developed intentional tools for practical purposes (like
spears), and tools and practices of attention such as gesture, drama,
ritual, painting, language, and an explosion of cultural artifacts as
they began to bootstrap their capacities further, scaffolded in this
way.  It was in this period that people began to tell stories and make
sense of nature in the best ways they could find to influence their
shared fate positively.
</p>

<p>
The next major shift in human social organization was driven by
agriculture.  Permanent settlements inhabited by unprecedented numbers
of people led to increasingly hierarchical social organization to
manage bottlenecks of attention, work, and governance at scale.  In
this period the hallmarks of civilization such as trade and money
arose to address limitations of personal and collective situation
awareness that rendered ineffective older established ways of sharing
in common resource pools.  Mechanical devices and managerial
hierarchies were developed to address the scale of work.  Heavy-handed
monarchies and religious institutions addressed problems of
discovering and coordinating social value at scale.
</p>

<p>
In the present era we are at the beginning of another major shift in
the scale of society, from a hierarchical civilization to a
decentralized network society. Near the end of civilization, the human
project of industrialization culminated in a generalization of
efficient work in the form of information theory, control theory, and
the invention of the digital computer.  Networked computers have
globalized the coordination of mechanical work, enabling ad hoc,
easily affordable, planetary-scale machinery.  Just as old methods
failed us when we formed large settlements, we now need decentralized
social organization in order to function at global and interplanetary
scale. <i>The main bottleneck is the need for tools that scale shared
awareness and organization.</i>
</p>

<div class="page">
<h3>SITUATED PROGRAMMING</h3>
<p>
At the traumatic height of the 20th century, cybernetics emerged as a
bold scientific, technological, and societal program that emphasized
the engineering of agent mechanisms.  Cybernetics was instrumental in
the invention and development of computing technology, which it cast
as a tool for designing and understanding systems organized by
mechanisms resembling the end-directed processes of natural
agents. The first high-level programming languages reflected the
machine and human sides of this project respectively, with Fortran
focused on efficient use of machine resources, and Lisp focused on
amplifying human expressive power.  As time went on and resources grew
more abundant, Lisps and other expressive languages became more
practical.  Parallel to these developments, user bases were expanding,
but at the cost of a growing divide in power between "programmers" and
"users".  Ever since that trend started, there has been a tension in
computing between programming being disconnected with situated use,
and use lacking the expressive power of programming.  Consequently
there have been many efforts to make programming more accessible to
wider audiences, and/or to make situated use as powerful as
programming.  The setbacks such efforts have faced have been both
technical (fundamental challenges in interface design, knowledge
representation, etc.) and cultural (respectability politics in
academia and industry, economic factors).
</p>

<p>
For a few different reasons, the tide seems close to turning.  Mobile
and wearable computing is increasingly ubiquitous and we are only a
couple of years away from affordable consumer <b>augmented reality</b>
hardware.  That means computing is more frequently applied to
activities other than just those ones that are best done sitting at a
desk.  Some of the original cybernetics ideas, namely neural networks
and agent-based learning have become wildly successful, and we are on
the cusp of practical <b>differentiable programming</b>, a functional,
declarative, data-centric approach to programming.  Efforts in
industry such as <b>robotic process automation</b> are aptly proposing
agents as an effective user interface model to give users more
expressive power.  The architecture pattern of <b>event-driven
dataflow</b> is gaining in popularity at the same time
that <b>decentralized data provenance</b> infrastructure is
maturing. Data provenance is the cornerstone of decentralized network
society.  As computing scales the labor dimension of collaborative
agency, it becomes necessary to scale social accountability with
respect to effects and motivations of work. Having auditable records
is essential to assessing and correcting faults, and for learning what
works and why, in repeatable ways. Only when the systems that extend
our agency and act on our behalf are sourced with reliable records,
can we make sense of them, take responsibility for them, and employ
them with confidence.
</p>

<p>
All of this points to the viability of developing a software ecosystem
in which open data standards and data in the form of private and
shared logs of first-class user-instrumented events, replaces
application-internal data silos, allowing for composable
agent-centered control.  Such expression and control can be directly
situated in and integrated into agents' lived situations.  Because
this is an approach of specifying agency and control as data, users
will ideally be able to make use of differentiable mechanisms to
program or shape systems painlessly <i>in situ</i>. While the
term <b>situated programming</b> does not yet have much
currency<sup>1</sup>, it is a very fitting one to describe this trend
of users gaining more of the power of programming and programmers
gaining more situational context, by use-centered, event-driven,
world-involving means.
</p>

<p>
A final major question is the concern of the next chapter: what sort
of data specification can adequately capture parameters of joint
attention underlying shared agency.  In other words how do we build
bicycles for the mind? This needs to be a central concern of situated
programming, I will argue, because scaling social organization
requires expanding our capacities to share common ground, whether
passively by means of high-confidence proxy agents or actively
influencing events that impact our lives.
</p>

</div>

<a name="the-art-of-bicycle-maintenance">
<div class="page">
<h3>THE ART OF BICYCLE MAINTENANCE</h3>

<p>
The colloquial idea of a bicycle for the mind can be defined more
precisely as the hypothetical minimum effective instrumentation of
individuals' capacities for joint attention required to effect maximum
tandem control of shared situations. What I propose as one approach to
constructing bicycles for the mind, within the broader context of
situated programming, is a practice I call <b>narrative process
scaffolding</b> (NPS). My own project of implementing NPS is an open
data protocol for coordinating joint attention that I
call <b>senters</b>.  Here I will describe NPS and senters at a high
level, but the full specification (a work in progress at the time of
this writing) can be found
at <a href="http://senters.info"><u>senters.info</u></a>.
</p>

<p>
In NPS, users <i>instrument</i> their active involvement in affecting
and being affected by their environments. NPS makes use of the kappa
architecture of event-driven dataflow programming, but at the user
level: events are known to and matter to users. This is
because <b>events</b> are inextricably tied to <b>instruments</b>.
Instruments are simple programs that track and emit events.
</p>

<p>
But instrumenting one's life with streams of events, even as a means
of mechanizing chains of reactions in support of useful functions,
does not in itself make computing more fluent and meaningful.  What
distinguishes the approach of NPS is agents' live sculpting
of <b>centers</b> of bearing on their lives and situations.  A center
is a recurring or persisting nexus of end-directed feedback.  To
scaffold a flow of narrative process among centers is to direct it in
terms of the three predicaments.  This is done using <b>gestures</b>.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Awareness gestures (engage or refrain): event indicates a center
to be aware of to potentially engage or avoid.
<li> Composition gestures (follow or voice): event indicates a
secondary center to be included as helpful or excluded.
<li> Organization gestures (exit or continue): event indicates
realization of process calling for exit or continuation.
</ol>

<p>
Gestures and other events are committed to narrative process logs that
can be shared with others selectively.  Logs that record gestures with
respect to instrumented events are recordings of what happened that
capture the relevance of the events to varieties of end-directed
activity.  Not only should this enable more "purposive" specification
of systems, but it should make it possible for users to exercise
shared and personal agency at larger scales with the help of
artificial proxy agents.  This is the case to the extent that generic
computational processes can be trained to successfully follow these
flows, given access to many shared records of experiments.  NPS this
way facilitates a declarative and legible approach to machine
intelligence that serves to closely augment human intelligence rather
than developing complex opaque behaviors that elude it.
</p>

<p>
The shared activity of organizing and repeating flows of end-directed
process is the essence of sapience and narrative construal and
sense-making. This presents what appears to be the most viable
solution to the problem of "knowledge representation" in
software. Crucially, shared knowledge emerges from being concerned
with others' narrative processes, and attending to signs of others'
successes and failures of awareness, composition, and organization in
order to provide feedback.
</p>

<p>
Narrative process scaffolding amplifies social and personal
intelligence by augmenting awareness, composition, and organization of
end-directed processes.  The practice of narrative process
scaffolding, to be successful, must generate an extensive field of
both widely and more narrowly shared topologies of centers that are
sourced from and which make sense of logs of immutable event data: an
ecology of bicycles for the mind.  Further, knowledge representation
as interactive attention-flow replay can be built using software
scaffolding of joint attention.  Doing so is our best bet in the vital
cause of removing the barriers to interplanetary-scale attention,
work, and social organization.
</p>
</div>

<a name="roadmap">
<div class="page">
<h3><u>A ROADMAP TO BICYCLES FOR THE MIND</u></h3>

<p>
The proposed narrative process scaffolding approach to situated
programming faces some challenges. There will need to be
a <b>user-level data sharing ecology</b><sup>1</sup>, more mature
consumer-ready <b>wearable AR hardware</b>, adoption of <b>NPS
practices</b>, and learnability of attention-flow by <b>artificial
proxy agents</b>.  The first two are industry-wide trends that are
likely to continue to grow.  The third concerns potential barriers to
adoption of what will admittedly seem to be an unusual approach to
computing. Two major shifts in user mindset are required: liberation
from applications per se in the "handing over of control" to
user-defined narrative pathways, and "turning inside out" of acting
inside applications to instead act in a world that one instruments and
scaffolds.
</p>

<p>
<b>Beyond "apps": putting users in control.</b> Narrative process
scaffolding has been presented as one answer to the still very new
question of how to design software that augments world-involving
socially shared activities. While the traditional application model
owns and controls what options users have available (without much
ability to fit meaningfully into activities owned by other
applications), in NPS instruments are simple and controlled by
gestures and other events, enabling them to be woven into narrative
flows by users.  The responsibility for discovery and control of what
options are available is turned over to users.  Fortunately users are
not on their own, having access to process logs shared with them by
other users, whose well-trodden paths serve as a guide. Rather than
downloading applications, users share references to repository
locations of instruments, in the course of sharing the data of
narrative processes that call for their use.
</p>

<p>
<b>Turning user experience inside out.</b>  Users are familiar with a
model in which an application is visited and entered into to do thing
the application makes possible.  In NPS, this is turned inside out,
with users instrumenting situated engagements in the world, most often
in tandem with the contributions of multiple other instrumented
sources acting as the basis of centers that are visited in narrative
flows. Instruments do not play the role of applications affording
information on options for action, rather it is centers that establish
ecological information.  Centers are supported by instruments in
conjunction with actual situations, established by histories of
narrative process.  Users define processes together as they go, as
flows visiting series of centers, each center scaffolding narrative
process toward the objective of that center.
</p>

<p>
<b>Machine-followability</b> via proxy agents is a key aspect of the
NPS approach.  Users organize (ideally as effortlessly as thoughts are
organized) modes of augmented activity by their relevance to
circumstance.  For proxy agents to helpfully get the attention of
their users in the most appropriate circumstances they will have to
learn from the data of many users' experiences through the use of
instruments that proxy agents are granted capabilities to wield in the
context of the center that scaffolds their actions.  Followability can
likely be achieved by known combinatorial and continuous optimization
techniques.
</p>

<p>
As a closing thought, the idea of narrative process scaffolding
differs from traditional computing in that it aspires to a kind of
fluency or <b>intimacy of instrumentation</b>.  When a proxy agent
carries out a process for a user as scaffolded, it is typically
following a short feedback loop, no different from the kind we come to
trust as our own thoughts and feelings.  Why do we trust our thoughts
and feelings?  Mainly because of our active and direct hand in shaping
them. And where they go wrong we work to correct them.  Our most basic
experiences are facilitated by manipulations of embodied instruments
to affect and be affected by ecological and social information, and
our use of external instruments extends the instrumentation that is
part of our bodies.<sup>2</sup> So ultimately narrative process
scaffolding aims to flow seamlessly with active perceptual experience,
empowering users with heightened involvement in the world.

<span class="endnote">
<b>1.</b> To the best of my knowledge, the first documented occurrence
of the turn of phrase was in a 1980 presentation by Apple Computer
co-founder Steve Jobs on using computers to amplify human abilities.
In so doing he paid homage to a key theme of the cybernetic movement
that gave birth to computers.  The title of this manifesto combines
this phrase with a reference to "Steps to an Ecology of Mind" by
cyberneticist Gregory Bateson, which explored the organization of
individuals, societies, and ecosystems in terms feedback and adaptive
self-regulation. <b>2.</b> In addition to bicycles standing for a
close fit between humans and technological extension, bicycles have
other fitting associations.  Bicycles influence urban planning toward
human-centered designs. They have historically stood for liberation
and empowerment, playing a significant role in feminism. Susan
B. Anthony wrote of the bicycle: "it has done more to emancipate women
than anything else in the world. I stand and rejoice every time I see
a woman ride by on a wheel." <b>3.</b>  Spoken language, by any
account a crowning achievement of our species (innateness debates
aside), is supported by image schematic and metaphorical devices for
coordinating construal of abstract domains (Lakoff 1993, Talmy 2000,
Goldberg 2003).  The use of these devices is so entrenched in cultural
practice that our use presents a task of unraveling mysteries for
years to come in cognitive linguistics research.

<span class="endnote">
<b>1.</b> Roughly 150 years ago a revolution in evolutionary theory
occurred, most notably punctuated by Darwin's "On the Origin of
Species". In that setting, the "pragmatic turn" in philosophy and
science began with Charles Sanders Peirce's project of reconstituting
knowledge, meaning, and phenomenology in terms of situated agents
calibrating meanings externally in networks of causative consequence.
The pragmatic thread can be traced through the work of Uexkull,
Vygotsky, later Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and many
others.  Crucially it led to the 1st and 2nd cybernetics movements,
the latter of which in conjunction with James and Eleanor Gibson's
pioneering work in ecological psychology has developed into the
"e-turn" or "4E" (embodied, ecological, enactive, and extensive)
cognitive sciences.  The underlying theoretical basis of semiotics
(Peircean, not Sassurian), cybernetics, and radical embodied cognitive
science is that meaning happens in the world, relative to the
predicaments of agents, and as such must be understood in terms of
processes of agents' involvement in the world over time. <b>2.</b> The
assertion that agents are necessarily and sufficiently defined on
three dimensions of situated bearing is likely the most controversial
(and also the most crucial to the case presented) I have made here.  I
have arrived at it by meta-analysis of theoretical and empirical work
on agents. I believe it is not only a well-motivated scientific
hypothesis, but is also a powerful user-level model for scaffolding

<b>3.</b> Eleanor Gibson and Nancy Rader in "Attention: The Perceiver
as Performer" (1979) explain that it would be misleading to regard
attention as a special mechanism to be studied, and is more
appropriately understood to be the activities of the perceiver-actor.
Attending is simply the conduct of world-involving, end-directed
activity.  The word is however useful in pointing out that an agent
must prioritize what to engage in, at the cost of engaging in some
other activity. The word becomes more of a reference to a distinctive
phenomenon in the discussion of joint attention, the phenomenon of
agents' states of attending being made targets of attention in their
own right, to be influenced and organized.</span>

<b>joint attention:</b>
<span class="endnote">
<b>1.</b> Alva Noe argues persuasively in "Strange Tools: Art and
Human Nature" (p. 65-66) that humans are a class of natural being
distinct from animal species.  This is more or less the point I am
making in distinguishing sapience from the more basic sentience that
we share with animals.  <b>2.</b>  Michael Tomasello's research over
several decades shows that directing the flow and focus of others'
attention in service of cooperative organization is the reason we
direct the flow, focus, and organization our own world-involving
activities. Basic ecological dynamics cannot be equivocated with the
reflective reorganizational process of developing the what, how, and
why of activity developed from from skills of joint attention.  Some
related work that builds this case for a duplex account of sapient
intelligence are Hutto and Myin's "Radicalizing Enactivism" and
"Evolving Enactivism", Chapman and Agre's "Abstract Reasoning as
Emergent from Concrete Activity", Alva Noe's "Strange Tools", Nancy
Salay's "Representation: Problems and Solutions", and Sabrina
Golonka's "Laws and conventions in language‐related behaviors".
Importantly, all of this work acknowledges that this duplex account is
usage-based, at the level of embodied agents situated in the world
together. Representational content is achieved by agents by means of
the tools and practices they use to scaffold jointly
attending. <b>3.</b> Ape gestures include "intention movements"
(abbreviated actions that have effects within social contexts) and
"attention getters" (actions that call attention, such as slapping the
ground).  Perhaps surprisingly, dogs (having had some time to adapt to
our cognitive niche) have experimentally shown far better
understanding of human pro-social intentions and gestures such as
pointing than other animals (Kirchhofer, et al). <b>4.</b> As Tracy
Harms puts it, "mind, as cognitive scientists and philosophers focused
on human flexibility are most interested, is characterized by an
expanse of reorganizational fluidity." Hutto et al (2014), on the
limits of this extent write "limits can be revealed by empirical
experiment. Even if one were able to see for miles one might not be
able to see for leagues."

<b>situated programming:</b>
<span class="endnote">
<b>1.</b> William Clancey explored "situated action" in the context of
computing in his influential 1997 book "Situated Cognition: On Human
Knowledge and Computer Representation". In 2002, Mills and Scholtz
published "Situated Computing: The Next Frontier for HCI Research",
exploring the reorientation to a data-first, agent-centered approach
to computing brought about by mobile and wearable devices.  They
write, "a future where people will interact with information through a
continuously varying array of devices that combine to form ad hoc
portals suitable to particular situations. In such a future, people
and information will be emancipated."  The term "situated programming"
was used by Rich Hickey in his keynote lecture at Clojure Conj 2017,
emphasizing effective programs, the importance of developing meaning
at the systems level rather than fixating on machine-level program
abstraction, and the agent-centered design of systems.

<b>1.</b> Dominic Tarr's secure scuttlebutt protocol (ssb) is an
example of the sort of approach I have in mind.  It applies the kappa
architecture or event-driven dataflow programming at the user level,
and for that reason it is a good fit for NPS.  Further
implementation-level concerns are explored in the senters
RFC. <b>2.</b> I have repeatedly in this manifesto nodded in the
direction of affective and sentic computing (see Rosalind Picard's
work as point of reference) which is an area ripe for innovation in
the emerging landscape of situated computing. Instrumenting somatic
states and scaffolding emotional experiences should be an integral
part of our augmented interactions.
