<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>
In the folklore of computing, the turn of phrase "bicycle for the
mind"<sup>1</sup> characterizes the aims of intelligence amplification
(IA) efforts by way of reference to the well-established scientific
fact that bicycles come astonishingly close to making total use of a
person's self-generated mechanical power.  A bicycle is the most
efficient vehicle to harness a human's own power toward locomotive
objectives.<sup>2</sup> Can computing technology similarly be used to
maximally leverage human powers of perception/action and narrative
sense-making?
</p>

<p>
The metaphor raises an obvious question: why not an electric bicycle,
or a self-steering sailboat, or a telepresence drone-- for the mind,
for that matter?  Power tools of thought are ultimately what we want,
but there is risk in putting them first.  The bicycle model of
amplifying human powers highlights the challenge of how to extend
agency with technologies closely fit to core human competencies and
needs.  Skipping this necessary first step seems to lead down a path
of not augmenting human capacities, but instead supplanting them in
ways that tend to integrate poorly with the actual interests and needs
of users.  It leads to inscrutable oracles that trade off
accountability and expertise for short-sighted convenience.
</p>

<p>
We do not yet have anything quite analogous to bicycles for the full
power of the embodied human mind.  But the history of human life has
been punctuated by the development of new practices and tools for
scaffolding and extending personhood.  I suppose we could think of
some of these innovations as wheelbarrows or shovels for the mind,
augmenting capacities to participate in the world in specific ways.
To measure up to the standards of the analogy from human mechanical
power, a bicycle for the mind must extend core human competencies.
What skills account for our unique cognitive ecological niche?
</p>

<p>
A clue is found in our collaborative graphical practices.  The very
earliest archaeological evidence of modern humans is littered with
tools designed to cooperatively guide attention.  In more recent human
epochs, the printing press, mass media, and the internet have expanded
the reach of graphical practices.  Scarcity of attentional resources
is a limiting factor, one historically addressed institutionally.
However, we have reached a point where institutions are a bottleneck
too.  In order for networked individuals to viably maintain situation
awareness at scale, it is necessary for software to participate in the
content of information, not merely its mechanical transport and
processing.  Computing tools must be capable of following and
augmenting our intentional processes.  In other words we need bicycles
for the mind.

<p>
<b>The thesis put forward in this document, following research in
ecological perception and joint attention, is that direct attending is
reorganized cooperatively through use of conventions for selecting,
composing, and realizing attending-- and it is this kind of
cooperation that makes human. The prescription for bicycles for the
mind that follows from this is to codify the scaffolding of attending
for machine followability, to augment situation awareness and
sense-making.</b>
</p>

<p>
I call this work a "manifesto" because I don't consider it an idle
theoretical exercise, but instead as advocacy for certain approaches
and courses of action that are motivated by real problems in society,
technology, and science.  Alan Kay once remarked that "the best way to
predict to future is to invent it".  Likewise the best way to make
sense of history is to excavate from it the most sound basis for the
direction one is inventing toward.  I survey three major trends
tracing all the way back to the birth of modern human primates:
attending, working, and organizing.  Starting with the origins of
joint attentional scaffolding and following a thread through changes
that have impacted the scale of attention, work, and social
organization, I draft a roadmap to an ecology of bicycles for the
mind.  I have kept references to authors, works, and prior art in the
endnotes apart from the main text to simplify presentation.

<div class="page">
<h3>AGENTS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTS</h3>

<p>
Two of the oldest questions in philosophy and science are "what is
life?" and "what is mind?".  Only a mere 150 years ago<sup>1</sup> did
it begin to dawn on pragmatic thinkers that these two questions are
actually one question: "what is an agent?".  To ask what an agent is
is to ask what the difference is between inert mechanisms and living,
feeling, self-steering mechanisms.  So the question naturally becomes
one of feedback and control mechanisms.  Agents are systems that act
to control parameters of environments that matter to them.  To speak
of an "environment of" or "mattering to" a system requires a physical
explanation, and that explanation is given by natural selection.
Mattering is a consequence of evolution because physico-chemical
arrangements are either ephemeral or they persist through targeted
manufacture, maintenance, acquisition of resources, and so on.  To
persist requires control of factors bearing on persistence, as biases
or preferences.  In other words, those things matter to the agent--
whether the agent knows it or not.
</p>

<p>
An agent, minimally defined, is a system that exercises control over
factors ultimately tied to its persistence as an autonomous entity
over time.  Factors that may be required for the unity of the system
to endure but are less directly controllable by the agent are called
the environment of an agent.  It is important to note that up until
here, when we speak of mattering to an agent it is meant strictly in
terms of outcomes that can be observed in the functioning of the
system by an outside observer.  What is called "perception" is an
agent's active sensitivity to ecological features called affordances
that bear upon control objectives.  To say affordances matter to an
agent, is to say that the real outcomes matter (both in terms of
learning effective habits and in terms of reproduction/survival
viability), and to remark on the first-hand phenomenology of
proactively leveraging ecological information.
</p>

<p>
Agents' end-directed prospective control can be described in terms of
three predicaments or stages in processes at which different factors
bear upon action.  Evidence for these predicaments derives from the
pragmatics of gesture in joint attention, explored further in the next
chapter.<sup>2</sup> Their efficacy in communication suggests they
constitute the ontology of agency.<sup>3</sup>
</p>

<ol>
<li><u>ATTENDING</u>: An agent is situated in environments that
affords many opportunities and threats demanding awareness and
readiness to potentially engage promising ends and mitigate perilous
eventualities.  Any engagement has opportunity costs, so an agent must
budget attention<sup>4</sup> wisely.  <b>The predicament of attending
is that of classifying events as indicative of means to valued ends,
in deciding to engage or refrain.</b>

<li><u>SUPPORTING</u>: Support, in the sense of contribution of work
or effort, refers to relationships that hold between a presently
engaged process and one or more potential or ongoing process. <b>The
predicament for the agent is to what extent does the work of a
secondary engagement contribute to (or hinder) the realization of the
present enagement's objective, in deciding to include in scope or
not.</b>  The phenomenon of concentration or focus is also expressed
by optimally excluding/including supporting or subordinate engagement.
The idea of focus is that only those supporting processes that
contribute to realizing valued ends should be involved, and others
should be excluded.

<li><u>REALIZING</u>: The third predicament that agents contend with
is that of organizing final causes. Final causes are those that
motivate the second predicament above and indirectly, the first as
well. <b>The predicament is that of defining ends, in deciding to
continue or exit. What defines the unique character or meaning of
realized ends is the specific set of options that are available to
exit to.</b>  In general, positions that offer more options (giving
the agent more autonomy, rather than being at the mercy of
circumstance) appear to be favorable, all other things being
equal.<sup>5</sup>

<h3>JOINT ATTENTION: THE HUMAN NICHE</h3>

<p>
Humans are a unique case among natural agents. What distinguishes the
"sapience" of humans from the more widespread "sentience" of basic
agents is its narrative character. The source of our narrative
abilities is the topic of this chapter.  Narrative presentation or
representation is not deep or intrinsic to intelligence by any means.
The rich variety of sentient intelligence in nature manifests as
purely pragmatic capacities of agents to steer events toward ends that
matter-- solely in terms of direct bearing on positioning or
readiness, often to the mutual benefit of agents.
</p>

<p>
Narrative agency is wholly due to a set of evolved capacities
constituting a cooperative infrastructure of communication that began
with gesture.<sup>1</sup> The basic gestural functions call attention
to predicaments of agency: attending, supporting, and realizing
processes.</b>  These skills allow us to collaboratively develop ways
of seeing and knowing, by intervening to fine-tune the selection,
composition, and motivation of decisions of what to attend to and
why. While other species do engage in joint attention<sup>2</sup>,
only humans attend to a shared focus and coordinate motivation for
directing and refining that focus.
</p>

<p>
<center><img src="assets/sentience-vs-sapience.png" height="200"></center>
</p>

<p>
Joint attention is important for multiple reasons.  One reason is that
it is directly responsible for human intentionally organized tools and
practices.  This is because when agents externally coordinate events
that bear upon attending, supporting, and realizing, they are defining
and shaping shared processes of narratively reorganized
agency.<sup>3</sup> Another reason, a consequence of the first, is the
development of intersubjectivity: the practices and tools that arise
in service of joint attention become a rich repository of scaffolding
that constitutes tacit and explicit common ground supporting the many
varieties of social interactions.  The accumulation of scaffolding
offers potentially endless options for agents to extend the reach of
their world-involving activities in socially sharable ways.  Somewhat
ironically, social practices establishing content made possible the
development of autonomous personal "selves" as nexuses of life
narrative, identity, and "mental" contents.
</p>

<p>
The earliest stages of human societies mark the beginnings of a
history of tools and practices (such as paintings, masks, signs,
speaking, etc) for scaffolding joint attention.  Scaffolding is still
by and large a highly localized activity between small groups of
people, though the coordination of local activities has been
significantly broadened by technologies of writing, the printing
press, mass media, and the internet.  Disseminable graphical practices
such as writing and diagramming exemplify
how <i>extensive</i><sup>4</sup> sapient agents are: the reach and
influence of involvement in the world is amplified by distributed
scaffolding practices. Bicycles for the mind aim to tighten or make
more immediate these wide feedback loops so as to scale awareness,
sense-making, and organizational practices.
</p>

<div class="page">
<h3>THE SCALABILITY OF ATTENTION, WORK, AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION</h3>
<p>
In the discussion above we've developed an account of narrative agents
whereby intervening in other agents' attending to three basic
predicaments of control (by means of gesture and scaffolding), agents
establish sophisticated narrative sense-making skills and practices.
The human niche in all of its cultural and psychological diversity has
been built in this framework of pro-social sensitivity to other
agents' states of attending to, supporting, and realizing objectives.
From these control predicaments and their derived communicative
motives and skills emerge corresponding cultural phenomena.
</p>

<ol>
<li><u>ATTENDING</u> Any social unit, however temporary or
time-extended, and however large or small, is confronted with the need
for coordination on what merits attention.  Agents develop a shared
awareness or common involvement in making sense of events as bearing
on shared concerns.
<li><u>WORK (SUPPORTING)</u> Any social unit is confronted with the
need for ways of having effects on the world together. Tools and
machines have greatly expanded our capacities to work toward
objectives.  Technologies of attention, such as diagramming and
notation, serve to affect agents' processes of realizing specific
ends.
<li><u>SOCIAL ORGANIZATION (REALIZING)</u> Any social unit is
confronted with the need to coordinate on final causes that constitute
"what we want to happen".  This can include anything from a preference
to avoid places with cold temperatures in an outing together, to
political causes, legal justice rulings, or the incentive structure of
a game.
</ol>

<p>
<b>Hunter gatherer/tribal society.</b> All evidence suggests that the
primary original driver of increasingly advanced cooperation amplified
by joint attention in proto-human primates was the stag hunt.  Big
game hunting required more than one person's help, and the better they
coordinated, the better results they got on average.  However early
human societies did not gather in groups much larger than other
primates did, because of the limitations of keeping track of one
another and coordinating collective efforts.  Humans developed
intentional tools for practical purposes (like spears), and tools and
practices of attention such as gesture, drama, ritual, painting,
symbols, and an explosion of cultural artifacts as they began to
bootstrap their capacities further, scaffolded in this way.  It was in
this period that people began to tell stories and make sense of nature
in the best ways they could find to influence their shared fate
positively.
</p>

<p>
<b>Agricultural/hierarchical society.</b> The next major shift in
human social organization was driven by agriculture.  Permanent
settlements inhabited by unprecedented numbers of people led to
increasingly hierarchical social organization to manage bottlenecks of
attention, work, and governance at scale.  In this period the
hallmarks of civilization, coins for example (out of the collectible
and gift exchange practices of forager societies) arose to address
limitations of personal and collective situation awareness that
rendered ineffective older established ways of sharing in common
resource pools.  Mechanical devices and managerial hierarchies were
developed to address the scale of work.  Heavy-handed monarchies and
religious institutions addressed problems of coordinating social
values at scale.
</p>

<p>
<b>Information/network society.</b> In the present era we are at the
beginning of another major shift in the scale of society, from a
hierarchical civilization to a decentralized network society.  Near
the end of hierarchical civilization, the human project of
industrialization culminated in a generalization of efficient work in
the form of information theory, control theory, and the invention of
the digital computer.  Networked computers have globalized the
coordination of mechanical work, enabling ad hoc, easily affordable,
planetary-scale machinery.  Just as old methods failed us when we
formed large settlements, the new global and interplanetary scale of
human interaction necessitates decentralized social organization.
Beyond developing robust distributed architecture discipline, what is
needed most is scaling shared situation awareness and organization.

<h3>SITUATED PROGRAMMING</h3>
<p>
At the traumatic height of the 20th century, cybernetics emerged as a
bold scientific, technological, and societal program that emphasized
the engineering of agent mechanisms.  Cybernetics was instrumental in
the invention and development of computing technology, which it cast
as a tool for designing and understanding systems organized by
mechanisms resembling the end-directed processes of natural
agents. The first high-level programming languages reflected the
machine and human sides of this project respectively, with languages
like Fortran focusing on efficient use of machine resources, and
languages like Lisp and Smalltalk focused on amplifying human
expressive power.  As time went on and resources grew more abundant,
Expressively powerful languages became more practical.  Parallel to
these developments, user bases were expanding, but at the cost of a
growing divide in power between "programmers" and "users".  Ever since
that trend started, there has been a tension in computing between
programming being disconnected with situated use, and use lacking the
expressive power of programming.  Consequently there have been many
efforts to make programming more accessible to wider audiences, and/or
to make situated use as powerful as programming.  The setbacks such
efforts have faced have been both technical (fundamental challenges in
interface design, knowledge representation, etc.) and cultural
(respectability politics in academia and industry, economic factors).
</p>

<p>
For a few different reasons, the tide seems close to turning.  Mobile
and wearable computing is increasingly ubiquitous and we are only a
couple of years away from affordable consumer augmented reality
hardware.  That means computing is more frequently applied to
activities other than just those ones that are best done sitting at a
desk.  Some of the original cybernetics ideas, namely neural networks
and agent-based learning have become wildly successful, and there is a
growing interest in ways of integrating machine learning techniques
with data-centric approaches to programming. Efforts in industry such
as robotic process automation are aptly proposing agents as an
effective user interface model to give users more expressive power.
The architecture pattern of event-driven dataflow is gaining in
popularity at the same time that decentralized data provenance
infrastructure is maturing. Data provenance is the cornerstone of
decentralized network society, because as computing scales the labor
dimension of collaborative agency, it becomes necessary to scale
social accountability with respect to effects and motivations of work.
Having auditable records is essential to assessing and correcting
faults, and for learning what works and why, in repeatable ways. Only
when the systems that extend our agency and act on our behalf are
sourced with reliable records, can we make sense of them, take
responsibility for them, and employ them with confidence.
</p>

<p>
All of this points to the viability of developing a software ecosystem
in which open data standards and data in the form of private and
shared logs of first-class user-instrumented events replaces
application-internal data silos, potentially providing a great deal of
data to peers for for training agents that automate processes.  Such
expression and control can be directly situated in and integrated into
agents' lived situations.  By specifying agent-centered control as
data, there is an opportunity for optimization of control, learning
from past outcomes. While the term <b>situated programming</b> does
not yet have much currency<sup>1</sup>, it is a very fitting one to
describe this trend of users gaining more of the power of programming
and programmers gaining more situational context.
</p>

<p>
A final major question is the concern of the next chapter: what
approach to information would allow software to helpfully participate
meaningfully in the real situations that human participants control
together.  In other words how do we build bicycles for the mind?  This
needs to be a central concern of situated programming, I will argue.
Scaling social organization requires expanding our capacities to share
common ground, and common ground is established through the use of
tools and and practices for coordinating attending to immediate
concerns together.
</p>

</div>

<a name="the-art-of-bicycle-maintenance">
<div class="page">
<h3>THE ART OF BICYCLE MAINTENANCE</h3>

<p>
The proverbial bicycle for the mind can be defined more precisely as
the minimal instrumentation of joint attentional skills required to
establish machine-followable common ground.  What I propose as way of
constructing bicycles for the mind within the broader context of
situated programming, is an approach to specifying the coordination of
joint attention, which I call <b>narrative process scaffolding</b>
(NPS).  I have begun work on a protocol for agent-centered
coordination on joint attentional scaffolding I call <b>senters</b> (a
portmanteau of "sense-making" and "center") as a way of implementing
NPS.  Here I will describe NPS and senters at a high level.
</p>

<p>
To review what was developed in the discussion above, there are two
levels of meaning when it comes to agent-centered information.  There
is basic, first-order causative involvement (direct
perception/action), and there is second-order convention-based
(gesture/scaffolding) re-organization of first-order activity by
controlling the selection, composition, and direction of activities of
attending to the world.  The approach of NPS is to <b>instrument</b>
activities of direct world-involvement, and to <b>scaffold</b>
convention-based processes of joint attentional orientation.
</p>

<center>

</table>
</center>

<p>
What are called <b>instruments</b> are typically simple functions that
affect the world, including visual and haptic interactions for
example. Users instrument their active involvement in environments, in
an event-driven dataflow<sup>1</sup> style: instruments produce events
when they are applied, on a feed specific to the agent's use of the
instrument.  Such events are in turn referred to on feeds for what are
called <b>centers</b> when the instrumented events are indicated by
means of <b>gestures</b> as bearing on either attending to,
supporting, or realizing the processes that a center scaffolds.  The
six gesture types cover empirically documented classes of
engage/refrain (attending), follow/avoid<sup>2</sup> (supporting), and
continue/exit (realizing).  Gestures signal the relevance of events to
attending toward ends. For example given an instrumented haptic event,
gesturing "engage" for a center for moving an object means that event
indicates an option to attend to that process.  Centers accrete
information that <b>proxy agents</b> follow to extend and support
users' actions.
</p>

<center>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
This approach allows for moving beyond an application model to a more
composable and adaptable approach.  Users leverage effective
crowd-sourced software behaviors custom-tailored to fit real
situations.  The phrase "turning the application inside
out"<sup>3</sup> is a good description of the fact that centers (which
are defined and shaped through use) replace the former role of
applications, in capturing what functions are are available, how they
compose, and where they get their users.
</p>

</div>

<a name="roadmaps">
<div class="page">
<h3><u>CENTERS: ROADMAPS FOR BICYCLES FOR THE MIND</u></h3>

<p>
The scientific hypothesis underwriting the technical proposal for
narrative process scaffolding is that something we've termed a
"center" describes and specifies the hard data of convention-based
guidance of attention, or "scaffolding".  This concept is actually
quite simple, but is subtle enough to be missed without a careful
presentation, so this final chapter makes that presentation its
objective.  The title of the chapter asserts that centers are
"roadmaps for bicycles of the mind".  Centers are the maps, not the
territories that are mapped; the territory in this metaphor is the
continuous flow of situated and embodied direct experience of
participating in what happens.
</p>

<p>
In the following examples I use the descriptor "top-down" for any
development/use where a center is engaged as scaffolding to direct a
series of events, and "bottom-up" for development/use where occurrent
events induce an appropriate center to scaffold contending with and
making sense of the events.  Also, a word on "development" versus
"use": use of centers is technically not distinct from enacting
entirely new centers, as any use of a center revisits its story of
development, and the record of its process can potentially scaffold a
future episode of use by someone it is shared with.  There is a
practical difference of degree rather than kind in leveraging (at one
extreme) a well-trodden center that one's present experiences add
nothing new to, and (at the other extreme) a center that has yet to be
formed with respect to histories of events.

<p>
<b>Example 1. top-down development and use of centers.</b> Alice, Bob,
and some of their friends go on a hike and pick a new kind of berries.
None of them are experts at picking berries.  Alice and Bob
individually draw from some centers that scaffold foraging generally,
including picking berries of known varieties. Together the group
collaborates on the development of centers to scaffold processes of
acquiring this new kind of berry, benefiting from and refining one
another’s findings as they progress, sharing with one another what
works well.
</p>

<p>
You have been hiking in the woods for days with no rations, but you
have a solar charging unit for your wearables. You access the local
woodland mesh network and find that many foragers have shared
scaffolding on their techniques.  Your reserves of agents dutifully
apply these centers to direct your attention to finding berries, and
other food.  There are also some relatively recently sourced centers
scaffolding the process of finding a new kind of berry you have never
heard of, but you don't follow it, because of how few participants
have contributed, and also because these pseudonymously signed
strangers (Alice, Bob, and their friends) have made it difficult to
link their activities to much else.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example 2. bottom-up development and use of centers.</b> You are
sitting outside in front of your home reading a book when suddenly a
car's screeching brakes break your concentration. A bicyclist flies
from impact with the vehicle's windshield.  After seeing to it that
the bicyclist receives medical care, you and the other nearby
witnesses recount what you witnessed, and develop a consistent
account, pooling pieces of recorded evidence, acts of claim-making
(witnesses', the artificial driver agent's, the bicyclist's) to create
a content-bearing executable narrative that explains, in a process of
joint attentional replay what transpired.  It is accepted and applied
as the basis of a "smart contract" insurance payout.
</p>

<p>
<b>~ EPILOGUE ~</b>
</p>

<p>
As these examples show, centers are histories of instrumented events
directed by joint attentional guidance.  Skillfully engaging centers
means being able to use them to scaffold novel circumstances they
apply to, following them through in episodes of attending toward
realized outcomes.  Many new ecologies of bicycles of the embodied
mind can be discovered as we share, develop, and use these maps to
experiencing them together.

<h3><u>ENDNOTES</u></h3>

<p>
<b>preface:</b>
<b>1.</b> To the best of my knowledge, the first documented occurrence
of the turn of phrase was in a 1980 presentation by Apple Computer
co-founder Steve Jobs on using computers to amplify human abilities.
In so doing he paid homage to a key theme of the cybernetic movement
that gave birth to computers.  The title of this manifesto combines
this phrase with a reference to "Steps to an Ecology of Mind" by
cyberneticist Gregory Bateson, which explored the organization of
individuals, societies, and ecosystems in terms feedback and adaptive
self-regulation. <b>2.</b> In addition to bicycles standing for a
close fit between humans and technological extension, bicycles have
other fitting associations.  Bicycles influence urban planning toward
human-centered designs. They have historically stood for liberation
and empowerment, playing a significant role in feminism. Susan
B. Anthony wrote of the bicycle: "it has done more to emancipate women
than anything else in the world. I stand and rejoice every time I see
a woman ride by on a wheel." <b>3.</b>  Spoken language, by any
account a crowning achievement of our species (innateness debates
aside), is supported by image schematic and metaphorical devices for
coordinating construal of abstract domains (Lakoff 1993, Talmy 2000,
Goldberg 2003).  The use of these devices is so entrenched in cultural
practice that our use presents a task of unraveling mysteries for
years to come in cognitive linguistics research.

</p>
<p>
<b>agents:</b>
<b>1.</b> Roughly 150 years ago a revolution in evolutionary theory
occurred, most notably punctuated by Darwin's "On the Origin of
Species". In that setting, the "pragmatic turn" in philosophy and
science began with Charles Sanders Peirce's project of reconstituting
knowledge, meaning, and phenomenology in terms of situated agents
calibrating meanings externally in networks of causative consequence.
The pragmatic thread can be traced through the work of Uexkull,
Vygotsky, later Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and many
others.  Crucially it led to the 1st and 2nd cybernetics movements,
the latter of which in conjunction with James and Eleanor Gibson's
pioneering work in ecological psychology has developed into the
"e-turn" or "4E" (embodied, ecological, enactive, and extensive)
cognitive sciences.  The underlying theoretical basis of semiotics
(Peircean, not Sassurian), cybernetics, and radical embodied cognitive
science is that meaning happens in the world, relative to the
predicaments of agents, and as such must be understood in terms of
processes of agents' involvement in the world over time. <b>2.</b> The
assertion that agents are necessarily and sufficiently defined on
three dimensions of situated bearing is mainly based on the work of
Michael Tomasello, Adele Goldberg, and other related work in their
usage-based program of communication research.  This research has
identified three ways in which humans learn (around nine months of
age) to intervene in others' processes of attending: sharing,
following into, and directing processes of attending.  These three
skills of attention are directly related to three identified
communicative motives of sharing, informing (supporting), and
requesting (directing) process.  These appear to be constitutive
factors of the human semantic niche of specifying shared intention.
In this manifesto I have taken the speculative liberty of
extrapolating the historical themes of attention, work, and
organization from these communicative skills or motives, as it seems
to carry its explanatory weight. <b>3.</b> Turvey 1992 also supports
this account of prospective awareness, supporting subacts, and
afforded ends.  <b>4.</b> Eleanor Gibson and Nancy Rader in
"Attention: The Perceiver as Performer" (1979) explain that it would
be misleading to regard attention as a special mechanism to be
studied, and is more appropriately understood to be the activities of
the perceiver-actor.  Attending is simply the conduct of
world-involving, end-directed activity.  The word is however useful in
pointing out that an agent must prioritize what to engage in, at the
cost of engaging in some other activity. The word becomes more of a
reference to a distinctive phenomenon in the discussion of joint
attention, the phenomenon of agents' states of attending being made
targets of attention in their own right, to be influenced and
organized.  <b>5.</b> A case for maximizing potential next options as
a default utility function for intrinsic motivation was first made by
Klyubin, Polani, and Nehaniv 2005, which they term "empowerment",
quantifying it in information-theoretic terms as the channel capacity
of an agent's actuation channel terminating at the sensor.

<b>joint attention:</b>
<b>1.</b>  Michael Tomasello's research over several decades shows
that directing the flow and focus of others' attention in service of
cooperative organization is the reason we direct the flow, focus, and
organization our own world-involving activities. Basic ecological
dynamics cannot be equivocated with the reflective reorganizational
process of developing the what, how, and why of activity developed
from from skills of joint attention.  Some related work that builds
this case for a duplex account of sapient intelligence are Hutto and
Myin's "Radicalizing Enactivism" and "Evolving Enactivism", Chapman
and Agre's "Abstract Reasoning as Emergent from Concrete Activity",
Alva Noe's "Strange Tools", Nancy Salay's "Representation: Problems
and Solutions", and Sabrina Golonka's "Laws and conventions in
language‐related behaviors".  Importantly, all of this work
acknowledges that this duplex account is usage-based, at the level of
embodied agents situated in the world together. Representational
content is achieved by agents by means of the tools and practices they
use to scaffold jointly attending. <b>2.</b> Ape gestures include
"intention movements" (abbreviated actions that have effects within
social contexts) and "attention getters" (actions that call attention,
such as slapping the ground).  Perhaps surprisingly, dogs (having had
some time to adapt to our cognitive niche) have experimentally shown
far better understanding of human pro-social intentions and gestures
such as pointing than other animals (Kirchhofer, et al). <b>3.</b> The
use of the term "narratively reorganized agency" refers to what is
discussed in the first endnote of this section.  Narrative process is
a kind of feedback process concerned specifically with the selection,
composition, and direction of what is attended to.  As such, it is a
second-order mode of end-directed feedback that is convention-based
rather than law-based in its relation to ecological
information.  <b>4.</b>  As Tracy Harms puts it, "mind, as cognitive
scientists and philosophers focused on human flexibility are most
interested, is characterized by an expanse of reorganizational
fluidity." Hutto et al (2014), on the limits of this extent write
"limits can be revealed by empirical experiment. Even if one were able
to see for miles one might not be able to see for leagues."

<b>situated programming:</b>
<b>1.</b> William Clancey explored "situated action" in the context of
computing in his influential 1997 book "Situated Cognition: On Human
Knowledge and Computer Representation". In 2002, Mills and Scholtz
published "Situated Computing: The Next Frontier for HCI Research",
exploring the reorientation to a data-first, agent-centered approach
to computing brought about by mobile and wearable devices.  They
write, "a future where people will interact with information through a
continuously varying array of devices that combine to form ad hoc
portals suitable to particular situations. In such a future, people
and information will be emancipated."  The term "situated programming"
was used by Rich Hickey in his keynote lecture at Clojure Conj 2017,
emphasizing effective programs, the importance of developing meaning
at the systems level rather than fixating on machine-level program
abstraction, and the agent-centered design of systems.

<b>bicycle maintenance:</b>
<b>1.</b> Dominic Tarr's secure scuttlebutt protocol (ssb) is an
example of the sort of approach I have in mind.  It applies the kappa
architecture or event-driven dataflow programming at the user level,
and for that reason it is a good fit for NPS.  Further
implementation-level concerns are explored in the senters
RFC. <b>2.</b> "Avoid" might also be substituted with "voice" in
reference to the notion of "voice and exit".  In the context of the
support predicament of a narrative process, some other process can
either be followed as supporting, or voiced as not supporting.  In the
realization predicament of a narrative process, "continue" and "exit"
apply. <b>3.</b> To paraphrase Martin Kleppman's (2014) "turning the
database inside out" in reference to event sourcing.  More broadly
speaking this approach is in the spirit of Licklider's (1960) vision
of designing systems that "cooperate in making decisions and
controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on
predetermined programs".
